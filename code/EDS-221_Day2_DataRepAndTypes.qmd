## Making and indexing data in R

### Vectors

```{r}
dogs <- c("teddy", "knora", "waffle", "banjo", "tallie", "shery")

# --- check class of dogs
typeof(dogs)
class(dogs)
```

```{r}
myBreakfast <- c("waffles", 2, TRUE, "coffee")

typeof(myBreakfast)
```

```{r}
weights <- c(50, 60, 25, 35, 55)
typeof(weights)
class(weights)
```

```{r}
weights_integer <- c(50L, 60L, 25L, 35L, 55L)
typeof(weights_integer)
class(weights_integer)
```

```{r}

zipcodes <- c(93105, 93104, 93101, 93401)

class(zipcodes)

# --- Use as. family of functions to recast a type from one type to another type
# --- Use is. family of functions to ASK a type what class something is
zipcodes_chr <- as.character(zipcodes)

```

### Create a vector with named elements

```{r}
dog_food <- c(teddy = "purina", knora = "alpo", waffle = "fancy feast", banjo = "blue diamond", tallie = "farmer's dog")
class(dog_food)

test <- c(cat = 4, dog = 10, elephant = 11)
class(test)
typeof(test)
```

```{r}
# --- access a value of the element in the vector
# --- R uses 1-index (IMPORTANT diff with other languages)

dog_food[2]
dog_food["knora"]
```

### Access ranges of values in a vector

Use: to refer to a range (low : high)

```{r}
trees <- c("ponderosa", "lodgepole", "jeffrey", "sugar", "white", "bristlecone", "redwood", "oak")
trees[3]
trees[3:5]
```

### Warm-up for "for loops"

```{r}
i <- 4
trees [i]

```

```{r}
# --- same thing as seq(from = 1 to = 3)
i <- seq(from = 1, to = 3)
trees[i]
```

```{r}
trees[3] <- "maple"
trees
```
